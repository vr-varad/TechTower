# TechTower

Welcome to TechTower! üöÄ

TechTower is a repository dedicated to documenting the various technology stacks I am learning and experimenting with. It's like building a tower of knowledge, one stack at a time!

## Purpose

The primary purpose of TechTower is to track my progress in learning new technologies and to serve as a reference for myself and others who are interested in exploring similar tech stacks. Through this repository, I aim to share my experiences, resources, and insights gained from working with different technologies.

## Stacks

Explore the various technology stacks I have documented in TechTower:

- [Stack 1](#): TypeScript
- [Stack 2](#): PostgreSQL
- [Stack 3](#): Prisma
- [Stack 4](#): AWS
- [Stack 5](#): FireBase
- ...

## How to Use

Feel free to navigate through the different stacks listed in this repository. Each stack includes relevant documentation, tutorials, and resources that I have found useful during my learning journey.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or improvements regarding any of the stacks documented here, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request!

## Contribution

Contributions to TechTower are highly appreciated! If you'd like to contribute by adding a new technology stack or improving existing documentation, feel free to fork this repository and create a pull request with your changes.

Let's build this tower of tech knowledge together! üèóÔ∏è
